/*Run this script to get the CSV files for ac50_data, assay_data
  NOTE: the file paths are left default due to the reason that mysql does not have access to write to them. I will still make sure that in the R script
  to improt that there will be no need to copy paste those files to different locations. But if you need to run it more than once you will need
  to delete them. as mysql does not want to delete them. Chem_data will be ran thru the R file directly and it is assumed that you have access to the data
